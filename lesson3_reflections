When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When you work from different computers or multiple work on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-So you are aware of any and all changes being made on the local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-a fork is a cloned repository made from 1 GitHub account to another GitHub account; allowing changes to be made without changing the original. A clone is a copy of a GitHub repository made in a local repository. A branch is a copy of a local repository allowing changes to be made without affecting the original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-more accurately track commits and changes
