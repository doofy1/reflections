What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-It turns the folder into a git repository, does not make any initial commit. Need to do it to use git version control on files inside this directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-it is a middle area where you add only the files you wish to commit. It adds value because it helps seperate out the commits/changes in a more controlled way.
