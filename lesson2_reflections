What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-It turns the folder into a git repository, does not make any initial commit. Need to do it to use git version control on files inside this directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-it is a middle area where you add only the files you wish to commit. It adds value because it helps seperate out the commits/changes in a more controlled way.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-use 'git diff' to compare the working directory to the staging area to verify the changes are enough to require a commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
-adding new code to a file while keeping the original working file intact

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
-they visually show how all the branches and commits relate to each other, including parent commits and detached commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
-all of the commits from the two branches get merged together and organized by time.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
-automatic saves time. Manually let's you resolve conflicts yourself.
